# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
Pyber is looking for insight into their ride sharing program. With the help of Pandas and matplotlib, Omar and I will be able to compare the total fares by city type. 

## Results
Probably not surprisingly, the Urban city type has a consistently higher fare total throughout the year. This tells us that Pyber should target the urban market for their product. Another thing to note is that the urban fare total seems to be more jaggedy than the other totals. We could say that the urban fare total has a higher volatility. This could be explained by the culture of urban living. It's my best guess that the volatility in the urban fare total is caused by the increased transmission of people on weekends. People in the city tend to go out more and need to hail rides inbetween their destinations on the weekends.

## Summary
My recommendation to V. Isualize is to focus her marketing and customer services towards the urban area. I would also suggest to increase driver and customer service capacity on weekends. Finally, I would advise that the look to expand into urban areas as she reaches out into global regions.
